## Project Instruction Updates:

1. Complete the function MemoryScheduler() in memory_coordinator.c
2. If you are adding extra files, make sure to modify Makefile accordingly.
3. Compile the code using the command `make all`
4. You can run the code by `./memory_coordinator <interval>`

### Notes:

1. Make sure that the VMs and the host has sufficient memory after any release of memory.
2. Memory should be released gradually. For example, if VM has 300 MB of memory, do not release 200 MB of memory at one-go.
3. Domain should not release memory if it has less than or equal to 100MB of unused memory.
4. Host should not release memory if it has less than or equal to 200MB of unused memory.
5. While submitting, write your algorithm and logic in this Readme.
